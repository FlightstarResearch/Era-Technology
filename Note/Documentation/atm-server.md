## Introduction to ATM:
An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic telecommunications device that enables customers of financial institutions to perform financial transactions, such as cash withdrawals, deposits, transfer funds, or obtaining account information, at any time and without the need for direct interaction with bank staff. The C/C++ language is very useful in ATM embedded. It works on accessing Web Services provided by the Bank as ATMC. The ATM screen is client-application 

The coding used in ATMC is **Pro*C**. Banks maintains a modules called ATMC (ATM Controller) as server for responding to requests sent by the ATM.

The **Pro*C/C++** programming tool enables you to embed Structured Query Language (SQL) statements in a C or C++ program. The **Pro*C/C++** precompiler translates these statements into standard Oracle runtime library calls, then generates a modified source program that you can compile, link, and run in the usual way.
